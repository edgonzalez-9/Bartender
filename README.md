# Bartender
Finds drinks that can be made from ingredients on hand. 

Step 1 - Create dummy data for drink recipes. 
    - Data will include drink name, ingredients, and proportions. 
Step 2 - Set up a visual layout of how you want the recipes to be displayed
    - Use semantic or another UI library for this, we want something to show for the moment. 
Step 3 - Set up a filter function that allows users to select from a drop down menu to narrow down options
    - Drop down menus will provide a minimum of three ingredients to narrow down with. 
Step 4 - Create a backend to store user recipes. 
    - Backend will alow the addition of recipes through the frontend interface 
Step 5 - Test adding recipes to the database. 
    - Use this to increase the ammount of recipes that are stored in the database.
