# Bartender
Finds drinks that can be made from ingredients on hand. 

<!-- Step 1 - Create dummy data for drink recipes. 
    - Data will include drink name, ingredients, and proportions.  -->

<!-- Step 2 - Set up a visual layout of how you want the recipes to be displayed
    - Use semantic or another UI library for this, we want something to show for the moment.  -->

<!-- Step 3 - Set up a filter function that allows users to select from a drop down menu to narrow down options -->
    - Drop down menu allows user to select a desired liquor. 
    - Drop down menus will provide a minimum of three ingredients to narrow down with.

Step 4 - Create a backend to store user recipes. 
    - Backend will alow the addition of recipes through the frontend interface 
    -- Not too sure about this part anymore, will rethink the app. 
    - Changing more things to get a submit in for the day.
    
Step 5 - Test adding recipes to the database. 
    - Use this to increase the ammount of recipes that are stored in the database.
 

    FLOWCHART OF USER EXPERIENCE AND APP FUNCTIONS

<!-- 1 - User loads page that has title and start options. DONE -->

<!-- 2 - User see the dropdown menu that allows them to select drink ingredients. 
    - There is currently a dropdown menu with options but it doesn't do anything. It needs to be connected to a function that takes the input and selects ingredients based on that.  -->

<!-- 3 - Once the user has selected an ingredient recipes will show up that contain the ingredients selected.  -->

<!-- 4 - The user can click on a particular recipe to see ingredients and instructions. -->
